Reverse Polish Notation Caluclotor

This calculator evaluates expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

An RPN expression like:

3 4 2 * +

is equivalent to the infix notation:

3 + (4 * 2)


Efficient evaluation of RPN expressions using a stack-based algorithm.

Optimized for minimal memory usage in the compiled object file.
