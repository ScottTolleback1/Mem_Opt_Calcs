Polynomial Solver

This polynomial solver is designed to handle exponents up to 2048, with performance optimized to account for memory constraints.

The solver is specifically crafted to minimize the size of the executable object file, ensuring efficient execution and reduced resource consumption. This focus on compactness makes the solver suitable for environments where memory and storage are limited.
